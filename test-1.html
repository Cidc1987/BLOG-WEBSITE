            <p>Who am I? Well I could start with my full name which is, Christopher Cid. I am a 32 year old Wanderlust Explorer. For the majority of my life I’ve always wondered what my purpose on this earth is. Why am I here? What do I truly want to do with my life? Is sitting on my ass staring at paperwork for 8 hours in the same office all my life? Absolutely f***ing not. I found my purpose, my purpose is to leave footprint memories everywhere I am or go that will stamp in my self-being that I call “My Journey”. Also, don’t forget the amount of mistakes I am going to make throughout this journey for my viewers to laugh and learn from.. ya know, I am just trying to live my life every 65,000 flight miles a time. Come see the world through my clear or sometimes blurry eyes. See for <a href="cruisingaroundtheworld.org"><strong>YOURSELF</strong></a></p>
